XML file that appears to contain elements with file paths
This entry makes me think it will only list 1000 files on one page <MaxKeys>1000</MaxKeys> There is another element notifying if the keys have been truncated.
The AWS S3 bucket api can only provide 1000 keys at a time, so you would need to stream all of them or get chunks of 1000 keys.

link that exists in above xml child element to download tif file

Possible enhancement:
files provide upper left latitude and longitude, cell resolution in meters, number of cells in longitude and latitude. 
This may be enough info to create a bbox/polygon and overlay on simplistic background map (maybe with state/county/SR boundaries).
