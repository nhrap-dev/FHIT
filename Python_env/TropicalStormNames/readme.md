Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific and Central North Pacific Storm Name list json files created on 6/17/21 from the following websites:
- https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml
	Atlantic Names - The six lists above are used in rotation and re-cycled every six years, i.e., the 2021 list will be used again in 2027. 
		Note that when a name is stricken from the list another name is selected to replace it. 
		If a storm forms during the off-season, it will take the next name in the list based on the current calendar date. For example, if a tropical cyclone formed on December 28th, it would take the name from the previous season's list of names. If a storm formed in February, it would be named from the subsequent season's list of names.
		In the event that more than twenty-one named tropical cyclones occur in the Atlantic basin in a season, or more than twenty-four named tropical cyclones in the eastern North Pacific basin, any additional storms will take names from an alternate list of names approved by the WMO for each basin.
	Eastern North Pacicic Names - These lists are also re-cycled every six years (the 2021 list will be used again in 2027).
	Central North Pacific Names - The names are used one after the other. When the bottom of one list is reached, the next name is the top of the next list.
